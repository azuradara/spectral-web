## Overview

This is the first public release of Spectral as a usable piece of software. While it is still bug-ridden and lacking in terms of functionality, it remains a better option than the default tab page in most web browsers.
<br/>
As of now, Spectral is only available as a downloadable Zip file that you have to install manually. However, there are plans to release it on the Chrome Web Store some time next month.

## Issues & Suggestions

Anyone who uses the application is kindly invited to submit bug reports or suggestions either as a Github issue or directly via [e-mail](mailto:dara-@outlook.jp).

## Features

- Realtime clock.
- Multi-engine search.
- Bookmarks manager.
- Customization settings.
